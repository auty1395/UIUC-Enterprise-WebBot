<h1> University of Illinois @ Urbana Champaign Enterprise WebBot </h1>

This WebBot is used to poll the University of Illinois Enterprise website
for information about whether a class is available or not. Just enter your
username, password, term and the specific classes you want the WebBot to poll
for and let the WebBot do its thing.


Some features that I plan on adding are:
<ol>

<li>
In the current implementation, the WebBot will simply print to the console
once it finds out that one of the classes that you are querying is now free. I am
working on adding functionality so that it can also automatically add the class.
</li>

<li>
Auto-completion features so that when you start typing in a given Major, Course
or CRN it suggests possible completions.
</li>

If you have some ideas, or if you want to contribute, feel free to get in touch
with me. :)

<h2> Disclaimer </h2>

<p>
Please note that I cannot provide any warranties on this software.
This bot has not been through thorough testing and while it works most of
the times, there might be some circumstances unaccounted for. Also,
if the UIUC Enterprise website is to change at any point, the WebBot might
break as well. Please use with caution.
</p>

<p>
Also, the bot is rate limited at this stage, please do not modify this behavior.
This is done to prevent the bots from bogging down the University of Illinois
server. Reducing the rate at which you poll should not be a problem.
